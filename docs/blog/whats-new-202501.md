## Features

### Mailing Lists

We are moving all of our discussions from GitHub to email-based mailing lists.  See [Mailing Lists]({{< ref "/docs/references/mailing-lists" >}}) for more information.

## Enhancements

- Added a `docs` command to quickly view the Etcha documentation website.
- Command line arguments now support partial command matching.  Etcha will attempt to match a partial CLI command (like `cfg`) to the longest matching command or macro (in this instance, `config`).
