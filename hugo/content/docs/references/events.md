Etcha's event system allows for users to trigger and chain [Patterns](../patterns) dynamically.  Etcha also uses this event system to extract information from [Commands](../commands).

## Triggering

All Events are triggered using Command [`onChange`](../commands#onchange) values--Events are specified here by prefixing their name with `etcha:`:

```json
{
  "always": true,
  "change": "echo hello event handler!",
  "id": "event issuer",
  "onChange": {
    "etcha:my_event"
  }
}
```

## Handling

Events are sent and received from [Sources](../config#sources).  A Source specifies the events it can receive and send.

## System Events

These are the event names Etcha already knows about and what they're used for:

### build_manifest

Firing this event during a `build` will add the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) to the [JWT's `etchaBuildManifest` property](../jwt#etchabuildmanifest).

### jwt

Firing this event during [`signingCommands`](../config#signingcommands) will set the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) to be the entire JWT generated by build.

### run_env_*

Firing any event with this prefix during a `build` will add the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) to the [JWT's `etchaRunEnv` property](../jwt#etcharunenv).

### stderr

Firing this event will log the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) to stderr.

### stdout

Firing this event will log the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) to stdout.

### token

Firing this event during [`verifyCommands`](../config#verifycommands) will have Etcha use the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) for the JWT Token.  Etcha will also **not verify** the token, as it assumes the verify commands have passed.

**DO NOT TRIGGER THIS EVENT IF THE TOKEN IS NOT VERIFIED**

### webhook_body

Firing this event during a [Webhook](../../running-patterns#remote-run-via-webhooks) will have Etcha use the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) for the webhook response.

### webhook_content_type

Firing this event during a [Webhook](../../running-patterns#remote-run-via-webhooks) will have Etcha use the output of the [Command's `change`](../commands#change) for the webhook content-type header.
