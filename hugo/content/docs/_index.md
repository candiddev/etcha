Welcome to the documentation for Etcha.  It loosely follows [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/).

The best way to start understanding and using Etcha is follow this path:

- Read through [Etcha 101]({{< ref "/docs/explanations/etcha-101" >}})
- Work through the [Tutorials]({{< ref "/docs/tutorials" >}}), shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
- Review the [Guides](./guides), starting with [Install Etcha]({{< ref "/docs/guides/get-etcha" >}}).
- Start writing your Patterns, leveraging the [References]({{< ref "/docs/references" >}}) if you get stuck.
- Deploy Etcha and push or pull your Patterns!
