The best way to start understanding and using Etcha is follow this path:

- Read through [Etcha 101](./explanations/etcha-101)
- Work through the [Tutorials](./tutorials), shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
- Review the [Guides](./guides), starting with [Planning Your Patterns](./guides/planning-patterns).
- Start writing your Patterns, leveraging the [References](./references) if you get stuck.
- Deploy Etcha and push or pull your Patterns!
